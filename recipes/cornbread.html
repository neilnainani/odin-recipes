    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted, or olive oil, plus butter for greasing</li>
        <li>1.5 cups cornmeal</li>
        <li>0.5 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1.25 cups buttermild or yogurt, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan with some butter</li>
        <li>Combine the cornmeal, flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk the egg into the buttermilk. Stir the buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients just enough to combine. If the batter is very dry and doesnâ€™t come together easily, add a few tablespoons more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Add the melted butter and stir until just incorporated; avoid overmixing. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it into an even layer. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top is lightly browned, the sides have pulled away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cut into squares and serve hot or warm.</li>
    </ol>
