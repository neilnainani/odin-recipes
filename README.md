# odin-recipes
This project is about making a recipes website.
So far, I have learned about how to add emphasis to text (italicize) or
make a text "strong" (bold). I have also learned how to add images from across
the web or images from my computer on to a website. I have also learned how to
add links to other websites and links to other sites in our directory in a secure
fashion.
